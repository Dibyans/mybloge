		<h3><p>My Favorite Hobby</p>
		<p>Keeping and Studing About Fishes</p>
		<p>I like fishes beacause unlike animals it can
			breath under water. A fish is an animal which lives and breathes in water. All fish are vertebrates and most breathe through gills and have fins and scales. Fish make up about half of all known vertebrate species. Fish have been on the earth for more than 500 million years.The four main health benefits of keeping fish are; reducing stress, reducing blood pressure and heart rate, and improving behaviour and eating habits of those who suffer with Alzheimer's.</p></h3>
